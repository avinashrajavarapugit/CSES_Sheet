# CSES Problem Set – My Journey

This repository is a collection of my solutions to the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).  
It’s not meant to be a shortcut — it’s meant to be a companion.

---

## 🌱 A Note Before You Read
- Please **try the problem yourself first**. Struggle a little, think a little — that’s where the real learning happens.  
- If you get stuck, these solutions are here to give you a nudge, not an escape.  
- I’m sharing this because I believe **we learn best when we learn together**.

## 📂 What’s Inside
- One file = one problem.  
- Written in a simple, contest-friendly style.  
- Languages used: **Python**. (Language doesn't matter, understand the approach)

If any solution feels unclear or you want to discuss an approach, 
feel free to open an **Issue** in this repo or reach out to me

## 🙌 Why Share This?
Competitive programming is a long road — debugging, failing, improving, repeating.  
This repo is my way of saying: *“you’re not alone on that road.”*  
If these solutions save you time, clear your doubts, or spark an idea, then they’ve done their job.

✨ *Keep solving. Keep growing. The sheet is just the start.*
